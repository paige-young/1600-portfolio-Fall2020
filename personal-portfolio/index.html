                <li>It can be really interesting to see the behind the scenes of websites and apps</li>
                <li>I want to see more of how designers and developers work together</li>

          <h4>JavaScript</h4>
          <p>I'm excited to learn more about JavaScript because i've never actually sat down and used it before. I know that JavaScript is a higher coding language that does more of the interactive side of development. If it's not just a static webpage then JavaScript is usually involved. I think the interaction parts of webpages are the most unique and really draw users in as well. I think it's also important to learn the basic languages when working as a designer so you know what's going on. </p>
